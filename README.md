## Requirements

### Forked from

```
$ git clone git@github.com:wkocjan/gatsby-contentful-portfolio.git

### Set up of the needed content model and create a configuration file

This project comes with a Contentful setup command `npm run setup`.

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API and then import the needed content model into the space you define and write a config file (`.env`).

This command uses content from `export.json` to bootstrap your portfolio with test data. To use your blog content from Contentful, export the data as JSON to `contentful` folder. Update the import statement in the `setup.js` file and run `npm run setup` command.

### Set up Mailchimp

If you want to use built-in integration with Mailchimp, please provide your unique endpoind URL in the `.env` file (`MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT` variable).

Follow [this instruction](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp/?=mailchimp#mailchimp-endpoint) to get the endpoint value.
